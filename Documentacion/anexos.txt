/// ENDPOINTS DEL SERVER ///

\subsection{Endpoints}
The web server only allow GET and POST request.
The GET endpoints are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item /
	\item /configuration
	\item /login
\end{itemize}
And the POST endpoints are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item /login
	\item /configuration
	\item /scp
	\item /pmnormal
	\item /pm1
	\item /pm2\_one
	\item /pm2\_eachone
	\item /pm2\_multiple
	\item /pm3\_one
	\item /pm3\_eachone
	\item /pm3\_multiple
\end{itemize}

The configuration POST endpoint allow the user to setup the server number of samples shown in the home page, the frequency which the samples are taken and the frequency which the scp send the new data files.

The SCP post endpoint permit the user to set up the scp configuration.

The other post endpoints are designed for change between the power saving modes, the 2 and 3 power saving mode are dividen in three endpoints, one for each input type to set up the this power mode schedules.

/// Directories in the project ///

\section{Directories} %TODO imagen del arbol de ficheros.
The project folder is composed by the following directories.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Logs
		\item Data
		\item Config
		\item CSS
		\item HTML
		\item JS
		\item Lib
		\item Scripts
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Logs}
Logs generated by the subsystems.
\subsection{Data}
Data files stored by the temperature subsystem and backups.
\subsection{Config}
Configuration files of the system. There are this files:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item crontable: file with the actual setted crontable.
		\item file\_size: size of the current and next data file.
		\item frequency\_scp: frequency of the scp transmisions, in hours.
		\item frequency\_temp: time between samples, in minutes.
		\item login: hash of the login and password credentials.
		\item powermode: actual power mode, number between 0 and 4.
		\item samples\_show: number of samples show by the web page.
		\item scp: address and credentials of the target machine.
		\item sendedFiles: files already sended to target scp machine.
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{CSS}
Style sheets of the web application.
\subsection{HTML}
In this folder are stored all the html files. These files are generated by a python script using the html templates stored in the template folder inside this same directory.
\subsection{js}
Scripts used in the web application pages.
\subsection{lib}
Python auxiliar modules used in all the subsystems. In this folder are stored utility.py, web\_maker.py, CookieStorage.py and transfer.py.
%TODO hablar de cada script aqui.
\subsection{scripts} %TODO enlazar en el texto a la seccion de los scripts
This folder store the power saving mode scripts needed for change the device configurations. The scripts should be moved to \~/bin for allow the server to use it.
